## How it works

1. on startup load metadata of given file
2. on every request from the sever send the loaded data

## Improvements

1. should be de facto built-in when using the new structure
2. make this work with streams (only really viable when 1 is implemented)

## Installation

1. install python 3 (I am using version 3.10, I have not tested prior versions)
2. install requirements from requirements.txt
3. start core
